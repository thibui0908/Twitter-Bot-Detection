# Twitter Bot Detection Using Social Network Analysis

This is the repository for Twitter Bot Detection using Social Network Analysis

## Introduction

## Details

The dataset contains information for labeled users, where we retrieve their tweets and followers. For constructing graphs, we start with the an original tweet from an account, then recursively collects retweets and follower relationships to represent edges and users being nodes. The idea behind this approach is to observe how information propagates in a real user’s social network and a bot’s social network.
